You'r in an infinite dungeon and you just go deeper and deeper.

You once woke up without any equipment and you don't remember anything before dungeon. When you walk somwhere around you see a [wandering trader] and decide to talk to him. He explains you that noone remembers anythin after getting here. Now the only thing you have to do is to defend yoursef and become stronger. "Traders give starting gear to all newbies, choose what class do you want to be [you can't change your class after!]"




Sometimes you'll enqounter traders and you'll buy/sell staf from/to them.
As you go deeper, enemies become stronger (by lvl)
